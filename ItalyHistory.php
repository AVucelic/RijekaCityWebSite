            <h1>Rijeka under Italy</h1>
            <p class="left">Rijeka, known as Fiume in Italian, was under Italian rule for several years during the 20th century.
                During this time, the city underwent significant changes and development. Italy invested heavily in
                infrastructure projects, building new roads, bridges, and public buildings. Italian architectural
                styles, such as Art Deco and Rationalism, began to influence the city's design and layout. The Italian
                government also promoted the use of the Italian language and culture, and many schools and cultural
                institutions were established to support this effort. However, this led to tensions between the
                Italian-speaking minority and the Croatian-speaking majority. Despite the efforts to promote Italian
                influence, the city remained a multicultural and multilingual hub, with a vibrant community of
                Croatians, Italians, and other ethnic groups. Today, Rijeka continues to be a diverse and cosmopolitan
                city, with a rich cultural heritage that reflects its complex history.</p>
