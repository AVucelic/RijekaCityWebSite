                        celebrated and performed today. Zajc began his musical career as a choirboy and later studied in
                        Prague
                        and Vienna. He worked as a conductor in several cities across Europe before settling in Rijeka,
                        where he
                        served as the director of the city's opera house for over twenty years. Zajc composed over 40
                        operas, as
                        well as numerous choral works, symphonies, and chamber music pieces. He was particularly known
                        for his
                        use of Croatian folk music and themes in his compositions, and his music played an important
                        role in the
                        development of a distinct national style of Croatian classical music. In addition to his musical
                        achievements, Zajc was also a respected intellectual and political activist, advocating for the
                        rights
                        of Croatian artists and promoting cultural and national identity.</p>

                        artistic and literary merit.</p>
