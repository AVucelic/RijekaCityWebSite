            <p class="left">Rijeka Film Festival is an annual event that takes place in the city of Rijeka, Croatia. The festival is
                dedicated to promoting independent and alternative cinema from around the world. It features a diverse
                range of films, including short and feature-length movies, documentaries, and experimental films. The
                festival also provides a platform for up-and-coming filmmakers to showcase their work and connect with
                industry professionals. In addition to screenings, the festival offers workshops, lectures, and panel
                discussions on various topics related to filmmaking. The festival is known for its unique atmosphere,
                with many screenings taking place in historic venues such as the 19th-century Art Nouveau theater, the
                Croatian National Theater, and the modern multimedia center, Art-kino. The Rijeka Film Festival is a
                must-attend event for cinephiles, aspiring filmmakers, and anyone interested in exploring new and
                diverse perspectives through cinema.</p>
