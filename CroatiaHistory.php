            <h1>Rijeka under Croatia</h1>
            <p class="left">Rijeka is a historic city that has been part of many different political entities throughout its history.
                While it was never officially under the direct control of Croatia as an independent state, the city has
                been an important center of Croatian culture and identity for centuries. During the medieval period,
                Rijeka was part of the Kingdom of Croatia, and it continued to play a vital role in Croatian history and
                culture even after the city came under the control of various foreign powers, including Austria-Hungary
                and Italy. In the years leading up to Croatia's declaration of independence in 1991, Rijeka was a center
                of political and cultural activity for Croatian nationalists, who saw the city as an important symbol of
                Croatian identity and aspirations. Since Croatia's independence, Rijeka has become a key cultural and
                economic center for the country, with a vibrant arts scene, a thriving port, and a strong tradition of
                academic and scientific research. Today, Rijeka is a modern and dynamic city that continues to play an
                important role in shaping the future of Croatia and the wider region.</p>
