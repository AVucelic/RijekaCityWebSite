            <h1>Rijeka Carnival</h1>
            <p class="left">The Rijeka Carnival, or Riječki karneval in Croatian, is one of the largest and most colorful carnivals
                in Europe. The carnival is held annually in the city of Rijeka, Croatia, during the weeks leading up to
                Lent, and it is a celebration of the city's rich cultural heritage and traditions. The carnival features
                a diverse range of events and activities, including colorful parades, lively street performances, music
                concerts, and costume parties. One of the highlights of the carnival is the traditional Zvončari
                procession, in which participants dressed in sheepskins and large bells on their belts, parade through
                the streets to scare away evil spirits and bring good luck for the upcoming year. The Rijeka Carnival is
                also known for its elaborate and creative costumes, which often reflect political and social issues, as
                well as the city's history and culture. The carnival attracts visitors from all over the world and has
                become a major tourist attraction for the city. The carnival is not only a celebration of Rijeka's past
                but also a reflection of its vibrant and diverse present, making it an essential part of the city's
                identity and cultural heritage.</p>
