            <h1>Rijeka under Austria-Hugary</h1>
            <p class="left">Rijeka, formerly known as Fiume, was an important seaport city under the control of Austria-Hungary for
                over 400 years until the end of World War I. During this time, the city played a significant role in the
                economic and cultural development of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As a major port on the Adriatic Sea,
                Rijeka was a vital center for trade and commerce, particularly in the areas of shipping, fishing, and
                shipbuilding. The city's strategic location also made it an important military base for Austria-Hungary,
                and it was heavily fortified with a system of fortresses and naval facilities. Rijeka was also a hub of
                cultural activity during this time, and the city was home to many prominent artists, writers, and
                intellectuals who contributed to the development of Croatian national identity. However, Rijeka's status
                as a multiethnic city, with a significant Italian population, led to tensions and conflicts between
                different ethnic and cultural groups, particularly during the period of Italian irredentism in the early
                20th century. The city's history under Austria-Hungary is a complex and multifaceted one, reflecting the
                challenges and opportunities of life in a diverse and rapidly changing empire.</p>
