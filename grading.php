            <h3 class="left">CRAP</h3>
            <p class="left">My color scheme was based on main colors of Rijeka, which are blue and white with yellow/goldish
                details. Colors are the same across all sites so it fills like the same site. Hoesntly it is not
                that great of color scheme</p>
            <h3 class="left">Organization</h3>
            <p class="left">Organization is decent because eveything is grouped where they need to be. I used images mostly for
                anchor (link) purposes, except where I explained just 1 something in details. There was not that much
                text since I tried to create it on my own (mostly with my own knowledge)</p>
            <h3 class="left">Content</h3>
            <p class="left">I would say that grammar is correct across all sites</p>
            <h3 class="left">Navigation</h3>
            <p class="left">The most user can go into site is 3 click, but they have navigation bar at the top at all times.</p>
            <h3 class="left">HTML5 and CSS3 use</h3>
            <p class="left">Used it!</p>
            <h3 class="left">Reference page</h3>
            <p class="left">I have reference page with links to the pictures. I created text so there is no reference for text.</p>
            <h3 class="left">Addition for the final</h3>
            <p class="left"> Fixed all issues from the 1st project, and added php files, some javascript, quiz and comments, and of course, validated it!</p>
